=========

Go web application for interacting with your Last.fm data.

I am almost always scrobbling my music to Last.fm. I always wished though that their website had a listing of tracks you recently discovered, or listened to for the first time. The crux of this application does exactly that. You login with your Last.fm account and, after the database is populated with your library in order of first scrobble time, look through your discoveries throughout time.
